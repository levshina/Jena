1
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,604
<i>My dear Frodo:</i>

2
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,605
<i>You asked me once...</i>

3
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,488
<i>...if I had told you everything
there was to know about my adventures.</i>

4
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,401
<i>And while I can honestly say
I have told you the truth...</i>

5
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,921
<i>...I may not have told you all of it.</i>

6
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,008
<i>I am old now, Frodo.</i>

7
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,285
<i>I'm not the same Hobbit I once was.</i>

8
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,088
<i>I think it is time for you to know...</i>

9
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,925
<i>...what really happened.</i>

10
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,887
<i>It began long ago...</i>

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,163
<i>...in a land far away to the east...</i>

12
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,326
<i>...the like of which you will
not find in the world today.</i>

13
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,886
<i>There was the city of Dale.</i>

14
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,486
<i>Its markets known far and wide.</i>

15
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,962
<i>Full of the bounties of vine and vale.</i>

16
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,642
<i>Peaceful and prosperous.</i>

17
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,809
<i>For this city lay before the doors of
the greatest kingdom in Middle-earth:</i>

18
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,521
<i>Erebor.</i>

19
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,050
<i>Stronghold of Thror,
King Under the Mountain.</i>

20
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,010
<i>Mightiest of the Dwarf Lords.</i>

21
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,811
<i>Thror ruled with utter surety...</i>

22
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,440
<i>...never doubting his
house would endure...</i>

23
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,650
<i>...for his line lay secure
in the lives of his son...</i>

24
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,689
<i>...and grandson.</i>

25
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,122
<i>Ah, Frodo. Erebor.</i>

26
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,567
<i>Built deep within the mountain itself...</i>

27
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,406
<i>...the beauty of this
fortress city was legend.</i>

28
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,006
<i>Its wealth lay in the earth...</i>

29
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,966
<i>...in precious gems hewn from rock...</i>

30
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,407
<i>...and in great seams of gold...</i>

31
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,723
<i>...running like rivers through stone.</i>

32
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,767
<i>The skill of the
Dwarves was unequaled...</i>

33
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,083
<i>...fashioning objects of great beauty...</i>

34
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,529
<i>...out of diamond,
emerald, ruby and sapphire.</i>

35
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,080
<i>Ever they delved deeper,
down into the dark.</i>

36
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,366
<i>And that is where they found it.</i>

37
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,722
<i>The Heart of the Mountain.</i>

38
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,642
<i>The Arkenstone.</i>

39
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,324
<i>Thror named it "The King's Jewel. "</i>

40
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,327
<i>He took it as a sign, a sign
that his right to rule was divine.</i>

41
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,087
<i>All would pay homage to him.</i>

42
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,689
<i>Even the great Elven King, Thranduil.</i>

43
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,890
<i>But the years of peace and
plenty were not to last.</i>

44
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,088
<i>Slowly the days turned sour...</i>

45
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,847
<i>...and the watchful nights closed in.</i>

46
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,683
<i>Thror's love of gold
had grown too fierce.</i>

47
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,091
<i>A sickness had begun to grow within him.</i>

48
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,606
<i>It was a sickness of the mind.</i>

49
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,204
<i>And where sickness thrives...</i>

50
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,730
<i>...bad things will follow.</i>

51
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,363
<i>The first they heard was
a noise like a hurricane...</i>

52
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,682
<i>...coming down from the North.</i>

53
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,085
<i>The pines on the mountain creaked
and cracked in the hot, dry wind.</i>

54
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,084
Balin, sound the alarm.

55
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,369
Call out the guard. Do it now!

56
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,851
What is it?

57
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,570
Dragon.

58
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,124
Dragon!

59
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,688
<i>He was a firedrake from the North.</i>

60
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,282
<i>Smaug had come.</i>

61
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,890
<i>Such wanton death was dealt that day.</i>

62
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,447
<i>For this city of Men
was nothing to Smaug.</i>

63
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,766
<i>His eye was set on another prize.</i>

64
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:36,162
<i>For dragons covet gold with
a dark and fierce desire.</i>

65
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,487
Aah!

66
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,367
No!

67
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,085
Come on.

68
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,971
<i>Erebor was lost.</i>

69
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,491
<i>For a dragon will guard his plunder...</i>

70
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,007
<i>...as long as he lives.</i>

71
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,889
Run for your lives!

72
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,725
Ah! Help us!

73
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,201
<i>Thranduil would not risk the lives of
his kin against the wrath of the dragon.</i>

74
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,527
<i>No help came from the Elves that day...</i>

75
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,245
<i>...nor any day since.</i>

76
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,001
<i>Robbed of their homeland...</i>

77
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,528
<i>...the Dwarves of Erebor
wandered the wilderness...</i>

78
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,008
<i>...a once mighty people brought low.</i>

79
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,802
<i>The young Dwarf prince took
work where he could find it...</i>

80
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,281
<i>...laboring in the villages of Men.</i>

81
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,006
<i>But always he remembered...</i>

82
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,640
<i>...the mountain smoke
beneath the moon...</i>

83
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,043
<i>...the trees like
torches blazing bright.</i>

84
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,562
<i>For he had seen dragon
fire in the sky...</i>

85
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,200
<i>...and a city turned to ash.</i>

86
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,288
<i>And he never forgave...</i>

87
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,563
<i>...and he never forgot.</i>

88
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,484
<i>That, my dear Frodo, is where I come in.</i>

89
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,650
<i>For, quite by chance, and
the will of a Wizard...</i>

90
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,567
<i>...fate decided I would
become part of this tale.</i>

91
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,810
<i>It began...</i>

92
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,201
<i>Well, it began as you might expect.</i>

93
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,042
<i>In a hole in the ground...</i>

94
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,766
<i>...there lived a Hobbit.</i>

95
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:26,164
<i>Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole
full of worms and oozy smells.</i>

96
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,482
<i>This was a Hobbit hole.</i>

97
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,965
<i>And that means good
food, a warm hearth...</i>

98
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,131
<i>...and all the comforts of home.</i>

99
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,443
Thank you.

100
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,765
What's this?

101
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,844
That is private. Keep
your sticky paws off.

102
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,408
It's not ready yet.

103
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,125
Not ready for what?

104
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,327
Reading.

105
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,521
What on earth are these?

106
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,570
Replies to the party invitations.

107
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,489
Ah. Good gracious. Is it today?

108
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,005
They all say they're coming.

109
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,000
Except for the Sackville-Bagginses, who
are demanding you ask them in person.

110
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,329
Are they, indeed? Over my dead body.

111
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,246
They'd probably find that quite agreeable.
They seem to think you have tunnels...

112
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:56,042
- ... overflowing with gold.
- It was one small chest, hardly overflowing.

113
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,802
And it still smells of Troll.

114
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,891
What on earth are you doing?

115
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,048
Taking precautions.

116
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,051
You know, I caught her making
off with the silverware once.

117
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,125
- Who? - Lobelia
Sackville-Baggins.

118
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,007
She had all my spoons
stuffed in her pocket. Ha!

119
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,400
Dreadful woman.

120
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,042
Make sure you keep an
eye on her after I'm...

121
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,531
When I'm... When I'm...

122
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,961
When you're what?

123
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,008
It's nothing. Nothing.

124
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,763
You know, some people are beginning
to wonder about you, Uncle.

125
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,571
- Huh?
- They think you're becoming odd.

126
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,286
Odd? Oh. Hm.

127
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,811
Unsociable.

128
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,884
Unsociable, me? Nonsense.

129
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,520
Be a good lad and put that on the gate.

130
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,726
- Do you think he'll come?
- Who?

131
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,247
Gandalf.

132
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,802
Oh-ho. He wouldn't miss a chance
to let off his Whizpoppers.

133
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,128
He'll give us quite a show, you'll see.

134
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,408
Right, then. I'm off.
- Off to where?

135
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,722
East-farthing Woods. I'm
going to surprise him.

136
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,209
Well, go on, then. You
don't want to be late.

137
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,566
<i>He doesn't approve
of being late. Oh, no.</i>

138
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,961
<i>Not that I ever was.</i>

139
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,090
<i>In those days, I was always on time.</i>

140
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,690
<i>I was entirely respectable.</i>

141
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,531
<i>And nothing unexpected...</i>

142
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,162
<i>...ever happened.</i>

143
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,321
Good morning. What do you mean?

144
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,484
Do you wish me a good morning...

145
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,883
...or do you mean that it is a good
morning whether I want it or not?

146
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,122
Or perhaps you mean to say that you
feel good on this particular morning?

147
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,771
Or are you simply stating that
this is a morning to be good on? Hm?

148
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,208
All of them at once, I suppose.

149
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,890
Hmm.

150
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,041
Can I help you?

151
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,284
That remains to be seen.

152
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,410
I'm looking for someone
to share in an adventure.

153
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,244
An adventure?

154
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:01,649
No, I don't imagine anyone west of Bree
would have much interest in adventures.

155
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,885
Nasty, disturbing, uncomfortable things.

156
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,007
Make you late for dinner. Heh, heh.

157
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,771
Mm. Huh.

158
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,924
Hmm.

159
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,127
Oh. Ah.

160
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,441
Good morning.

161
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,524
To think that I should have
lived to be "good morninged"...

162
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,686
...by Belladonna Took's son as if
I were selling buttons at the door.

163
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,370
Beg your pardon?

164
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,206
You've changed, and not entirely
for the better, Bilbo Baggins.

165
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,521
I'm sorry, do I know you?

166
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,803
Well, you know my name, although
you don't remember I belong to it.

167
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,610
I'm Gandalf.

168
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,967
And Gandalf means...

169
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,325
<i>...me.</i>

170
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,682
Gandalf? Not Gandalf
the wandering Wizard...

171
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,888
...who made such excellent fireworks?

172
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,886
Old Took used to have them on
Midsummer's Eve. Heh, heh. Ahem.

173
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,204
No idea you were still in business.

174
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,810
And where else should I be?

175
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,731
Where else...? Ahem.

176
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,446
Well, I'm pleased to find you
remember something about me...

177
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,610
...even if it's only my fireworks.

178
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,760
Yes. Well, that's decided.

179
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,729
It'll be very good for you...

180
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,970
...and most amusing for me.

181
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,804
I shall inform the others.

182
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,248
Inform the who? What?
No. No. No... Wait.

183
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,924
We do not want any adventures
here, thank you. Not today. Not...

184
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,880
I suggest you try Over the
Hill or Across the Water.

185
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,684
Good morning.

186
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,763
Dwalin, at your service.

187
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,726
Hm. Uh...

188
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,926
Bilbo Baggins, at yours.

189
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,131
Do we know each other?

190
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,446
No.

191
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,410
Which way, laddie? Is it down here?

192
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,967
Is what down where?

193
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,167
<i>Supper.</i>

194
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,565
He said there'd be food and lots of it.

195
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,883
He... He said? Who said?

196
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,530
Mmm.

197
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,365
Mmm.

198
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,530
Very good, this. Any more?

199
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,726
What? Oh, yes, yes. Ah.

200
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,090
Help yourself.

201
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:03,205
Hmm. It's just that, urn,
I wasn't expecting company.

202
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,688
That'll be the door.

203
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,843
Balin, at your service.

204
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,610
- Good evening.
- Yes. Yes, it is.

205
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,566
- Though I think it might rain later.
- Hm?

206
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,926
Am I late?

207
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,324
Late for what?

208
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,525
Oh! Ha, ha!

209
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,449
Evening, brother.

210
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,922
By my beard...

211
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,084
...you're shorter and
wider than last we met.

212
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,890
Wider, not shorter.

213
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,006
Sharp enough for both of us.

214
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,850
Uh, excuse me? Sorry,
I hate to interrupt.

215
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,130
But the thing is, I'm not entirely
sure you're in the right house.

216
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,367
Have you eaten?

217
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,481
It's not that I don't like visitors. I
like visitors as much as the next Hobbit.

218
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,247
But I do like to know them
before they come visiting.

219
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,731
- What is this?
- I don't know.

220
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,770
- I think it's cheese. Gone
blue. It's riddled with mold.

221
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,648
The thing is, I don't know either
of you. Not in the slightest.

222
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,684
I don't mean to be blunt,
but I had to speak my mind.

223
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,848
I'm sorry. You think...?

224
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,091
apology accepted.

225
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,607
- Ah.
- Now, fill it up, brother, don't stint.

226
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,362
You wanna get stuck in?
- I could eat again if you insist, brother.

227
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,089
- Fili.
- And Kili.

228
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,089
At your service.

229
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,601
- You must be Mr. Boggins.
- Nope! You can't come in.

230
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,161
- You've come to the wrong house.
- What?

231
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,561
- Has it been canceled?
- No one told us.

232
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,561
- No, nothing's been canceled.
- That's a relief.

233
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,601
Careful with these. I
just had them sharpened.

234
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,609
It's nice, this place. Yeah.

235
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,009
- Did you do it yourself?
- What? No, it's been in the family for years.

236
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,050
That's my mother's glory box.
Can you please not do that?

237
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,851
Fili, Kili. Come on, give us a hand.

238
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,321
Mr. Dwalin. Ha, ha.

239
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,124
Shove this in the hallway. Otherwise
we'll never get everyone in.

240
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,009
"Everyone"? How many more are there?

241
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,242
Where do you want this?
- Oh, no.

242
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,086
It's really heavy.
- No. No. There's nobody home!

243
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,011
Go away and bother somebody else.

244
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,409
There's far too many Dwarves
in my dining room as it is.

245
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,531
If this is some clot-head's
idea of a joke...

246
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,207
...I can only say it
is in very poor taste.

247
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,569
Get off, you big lump!

248
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,486
Gandalf.

249
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,970
Those are my pri...! Excuse me, not
my wine. Put that back. Put that back.

250
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,202
Not the jam, please.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

251
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,131
It's a tad excessive, isn't
it? Have you got a cheese knife?

252
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,290
- "Cheese knife"? He
eats it by the block. Ugh.

253
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,762
No, that's Grandpa Mungo's chair...
No, so is that. Take it back, please.

254
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,766
- I cannot hear what you're saying.
It's an antique. Not for sitting on.

255
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,685
That is a book, not a
coaster. And put that map down.

256
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,922
- Excuse me, Mr. Gandalf?
- Yes?

257
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,731
May I tempt you with a cup of chamomile?

258
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:26,767
Oh, no, thank you, Dori. A
little red wine for me, I think.

259
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,289
Whoop! Mind out.
- Yes. Ah.

260
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,004
Uh, Fili, Kili. Uh...

261
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,242
Oin, Gloin.

262
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,444
Dwalin, Balin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur...

263
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,251
- ... Dori, Nori. Ori!
- No. Not my prizewinners, thank you.

264
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,004
No, thank you.

265
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,686
Yes, you're quite right, Bifur.

266
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,161
We appear to be one Dwarf short.

267
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:00,770
He is late, is all. He traveled north
to a meeting of our kin. He will come.

268
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,681
Mr. Gandalf? A little glass
of red wine, as requested.

269
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,928
It's got a fruity bouquet.

270
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,367
Oh. Cheers.

271
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,366
Bombur's on his second
leg of lamb already.

272
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,127
Hmm.

273
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,046
No chance. Not from that distance.

274
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,406
Wanna bet?

275
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,050
Bombur, catch!

276
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,364
I'll help you with that.

277
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,448
Oh, you great galumphing git!

278
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,683
- Who wants an ale? There
you go. Over here, brother.

279
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,083
I said have another drink. Here you go.

280
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,525
Ale on the count of three!

281
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,131
One, two...

282
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,327
Up!

283
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,050
I knew you had it in you!

284
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,931
Excuse me, that is a
doily, not a dishcloth.

285
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,127
But it's full of holes.

286
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,482
It's supposed to look
like that. It's crochet.

287
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,564
And a wonderful game it is too,
if you've got the balls for it.

288
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,688
Bebother and confusticate these Dwarves!

289
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,730
My dear Bilbo, what
on earth is the matter?

290
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,724
What's the matter? I'm
surrounded by Dwarves.

291
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,490
What are they doing here?

292
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,406
Oh, they're quite a merry
gathering once you get used to them.

293
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,528
I don't want to get used to them.

294
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,883
Look at the state of my kitchen.
There's mud trod into the carpet.

295
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,451
They've pillaged the pantry.

296
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,041
I won't tell you what
they've done in the bathroom.

297
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,000
They've destroyed the plumbing. I don't
understand what they're doing in my house!

298
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:47,485
Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt,
but what should I do with my plate?

299
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,847
Here you go, Ori. Give it to me.

300
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,682
Take that back. Excuse me.

301
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,763
That's my mother's
West Farthing pottery.

302
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,922
It's over 100 years old!

303
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,886
And can you not do
that? You'll blunt them.

304
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,042
Ooh. Do you hear that, lads?

305
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,485
He says we'll blunt the knives.

306
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,563
<i>Blunt the knives, bend the forks</i>

307
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,240
<i>Smash the bottles and burn the corks</i>

308
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,643
<i>Chip the glasses and crack the plates</i>

309
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,643
<i>That's what Bilbo Baggins hates</i>

310
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,325
<i>Cut the cloth, tread on the fat</i>

311
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,409
<i>Leave the bones on the bedroom mat</i>

312
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,042
<i>Pour the milk on the pantry floor</i>

313
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,282
<i>Splash the wine on every door</i>

314
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,090
<i>Dump the crooks in a boiling bowl</i>

315
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,930
<i>Pound them up with a thumping pole</i>

316
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,290
<i>When you're finished, if they are whole</i>

317
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,567
<i>Send them down the hall to roll</i>

318
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,161
<i>That's what Bilbo Baggins hates</i>

319
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,128
Bilbo.

320
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,849
He is here.

321
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,882
Gandalf.

322
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,566
I thought you said this
place would be easy to find.

323
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,722
I lost my way, twice.

324
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,327
I wouldn't have found it at all had
it not been for that mark on the door.

325
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,370
Mark? There's no mark on that
door. It was painted a week ago.

326
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,922
There is a mark. I put it there myself.

327
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:35,645
Bilbo Baggins, allow me to
introduce the leader of our company:

328
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,208
Thorin Oakenshield.

329
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,930
So...

330
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,329
...this is the Hobbit.

331
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,567
Tell me, Mr. Baggins, have
you done much fighting?

332
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,210
Pardon me? Ax or sword?

333
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,405
What's your weapon of choice?

334
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:54,042
Well, I do have some skill at
conkers, if you must know...

335
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,807
...but I fail to see
why that's relevant.

336
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,810
Thought as much.

337
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,770
He looks more like a
grocer than a burglar.

338
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,727
What news from the meeting in
Ered Luin? Did they all come?

339
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,969
- Aye. Envoys from all
seven kingdoms. All of them!

340
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,726
And what did the Dwarves
of the Iron Hills say?

341
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,843
Is Dain with us?

342
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,690
They will not come.

343
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:32,284
They say this quest
is ours and ours alone.

344
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,846
You're going on a quest?

345
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:42,885
Bilbo, my dear fellow, let
us have a little more light.

346
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,402
Far to the east...

347
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,525
...over ranges and rivers...

348
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,122
...beyond woodlands and wastelands...

349
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,647
...lies a single, solitary peak.

350
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,969
"The Lonely Mountain. "

351
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,643
Aye, Oin has read the portents...

352
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:07,247
...and the portents say it is time.

353
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,447
Ravens have been seen flying back
to the mountain, as it was foretold.

354
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,571
"When the birds of
yore return to Erebor...

355
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,202
...the reign of the beast will end. "

356
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,608
Uh, what beast?

357
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,081
That would be a reference
to Smaug the Terrible...

358
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,086
...chiefest and greatest
calamity of our age.

359
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,569
Airborne fire-breather.

360
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,530
Teeth like razors,
claws like meat hooks.

361
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,763
- Extremely fond of precious metals.
- Yes, I know what a dragon is.

362
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,490
I'm not afraid. I'm up for it.

363
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,570
I'll give him a taste of Dwarfish
iron right up his jacksie!

364
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,250
Good lad, Ori!
- Sit down.

365
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,370
The task would be difficult
enough with an army behind us...

366
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,722
...but we number just 13.

367
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,803
And not 13 of the best...

368
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,726
...nor brightest.

369
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,128
Here, who are you calling dim?

370
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,845
Sorry, what did he say?

371
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,923
We may be few in number...

372
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,526
...but we're fighters, all
of us, to the last Dwarf.

373
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,126
And you forget, we have
a Wizard in our company.

374
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,090
Gandalf will have killed
hundreds of dragons in his time.

375
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,242
Oh, well, no. I wouldn't say...

376
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,402
How many, then?
- What?

377
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,927
Well, how many dragons have you killed?

378
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,327
Go on. Give us a number.

379
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,007
Excuse me. Please.

380
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,365
If we have read these signs...

381
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,211
...do you not think others
will have read them too?

382
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,086
Rumors have begun to spread.

383
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,205
The dragon, Smaug, has
not been seen for 60 years.

384
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,127
Eyes look east to the
mountain, assessing...

385
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,282
...wondering, weighing the risk.

386
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,490
Perhaps the vast wealth of our
people now lies unprotected.

387
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,167
Do we sit back while others
claim what is rightfully ours?

388
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,690
Or do we seize this
chance to take back Erebor?

389
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,804
You forget, the Front Gate is sealed.

390
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,284
There is no way into the mountain.

391
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,762
That, my dear Balin,
is not entirely true.

392
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,211
How came you by this?

393
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,651
It was given to me by your father.

394
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,088
By Thrain. For safekeeping.

395
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,969
It is yours now.

396
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,771
If there is a key...

397
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,404
...there must be a door.

398
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,524
These runes speak of a hidden
passage to the Lower Halls.

399
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,882
There's another way in.

400
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,886
Well, if we can find it, but Dwarf
doors are invisible when closed.

401
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,044
The answer lies hidden
somewhere in this map...

402
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,202
...and I do not have
the skill to find it.

403
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,769
But there are others
in Middle-earth who can.

404
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,922
The task I have in mind will
require a great deal of stealth...

405
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,208
...and no small amount of courage.

406
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:17,161
But if we are careful and clever,
I believe that it can be done.

407
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,845
That's why we need a burglar.

408
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,647
Hmm. And a good one too.
An expert, I'd imagine.

409
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,127
And are you?

410
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,045
Am I what?

411
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,965
He said he's an expert. Hey.

412
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,327
Me? No. No, no, no. I'm not a burglar.
I've never stolen a thing in my life.

413
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,205
Well, I'm afraid I have
to agree with Mr. Baggins.

414
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,448
He's hardly burglar material.

415
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,647
Nope.

416
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:48,089
Aye, the Wild is no place for gentle folk
who can neither fight nor fend for themselves.

417
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,089
He's just fine.

418
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,926
Enough!

419
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:02,081
If I say Bilbo Baggins is a
burglar, then a burglar he is.

420
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,884
Hobbits are remarkably
light on their feet.

421
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,283
In fact, they can pass unseen
by most, if they choose.

422
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,081
And, while the dragon is
accustomed to the smell of Dwarf...

423
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,323
...the scent of a Hobbit
is all but unknown to him...

424
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,689
...which gives us a distinct advantage.

425
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,243
You asked me to find the 14th member of
this company and I have chosen Mr. Baggins.

426
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,530
There's a lot more to him
than appearances suggest.

427
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,524
And he's got a great deal more
to offer than any of you know.

428
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,445
Including himself.

429
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,646
You must trust me on this.

430
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,051
Very well.

431
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,004
- We will do it your way.
- No, no.

432
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,561
Give him the contract.
- We're in. We're off.

433
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,841
It's just the usual.

434
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,968
Summary of
out-of-pocket expenses...

435
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,770
...time required, remuneration...

436
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,764
...funeral arrangements, so forth.

437
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,125
Funeral arrangements?

438
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,490
I cannot guarantee his safety.

439
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,406
Understood.

440
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,411
Nor will I be responsible for his fate.

441
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,606
Agreed.

442
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,368
"Terms: Cash on delivery, up to but not exceeding
one-fourteenth of total profit, if any. "

443
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,409
Hmm. Seems fair.

444
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,281
"Present company shall not be
liable for injuries inflicted by...

445
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:33,731
...or sustained as a consequence thereof,
including, but not limited to lacerations...

446
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,849
...evisceration... "

447
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,447
Incineration?

448
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,610
Aye. He'll melt the flesh off
your bones in the blink of an eye.

449
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,764
- You all right, laddie?
- Huh? Yeah.

450
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,851
Feel a bit faint.

451
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,242
Think furnace with wings. Air.

452
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,845
I need air.

453
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,606
Flash of light, searing pain, then poof.

454
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,762
You're nothing more than a pile of ash.

455
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,325
Hmm.

456
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,207
Nope.

457
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,249
Oh, very helpful, Bofur.

458
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,166
I'll be all right. Just let
me sit quietly for a moment.

459
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,688
You've been sitting
quietly for far too long.

460
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,130
Tell me, when did doilies
and your mother's dishes...

461
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,964
...become so important to you?

462
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:32,361
I remember a young Hobbit who was always
running off in search of Elves in the woods.

463
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,683
Who would stay out late,
come home after dark...

464
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,481
...trailing mud and twigs and fireflies.

465
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,086
A young Hobbit who would
have liked nothing better...

466
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,642
...than to find out what was
beyond the borders of the Shire.

467
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,120
The world is not in your books and maps.

468
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,283
It's out there.

469
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,241
I can't just go running
off into the blue.

470
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,609
I am a Baggins of Bag-end.

471
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,888
You are also a Took.

472
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,208
Did you know that your
great-great-great-great-uncle Bullroarer Took...

473
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,011
...was so large, he
could ride a real horse?

474
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,367
- Yes.
- Yes, well, he could.

475
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,410
In the Battle of Green Fields,
he charged the Goblin ranks.

476
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,406
He swung his club so hard, it knocked
the Goblin king's head clean off...

477
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,724
...and it sailed 100 yards through
the air and went down a rabbit hole.

478
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,644
And thus, the battle was won.

479
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,444
And the game of golf
invented at the same time.

480
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,847
I do believe you made that up.

481
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,721
Well, all good stories
deserve embellishment.

482
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:45,211
You'll have a tale or two to tell
of your own when you come back.

483
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,167
Can you promise that I will come back?

484
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,690
No.

485
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,888
And if you do...

486
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,007
...you will not be the same.

487
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,364
That's what I thought.

488
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,569
Sorry, Gandalf, I can't sign this.

489
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,361
You've got the wrong Hobbit.

490
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,401
It appears we have lost our burglar.

491
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,442
Probably for the best.

492
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,007
The odds were always against us.

493
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,164
After all, what are we?

494
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,564
Merchants, miners...

495
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,327
...tinkers, toy-makers.

496
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,484
Heh, heh. Hardly the stuff of legend.

497
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,764
There are a few warriors amongst us.

498
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,329
Old warriors.

499
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,847
I would take each and every
one of these Dwarves...

500
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,202
...over an army from the Iron Hills.

501
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,284
For when I called upon
them, they answered.

502
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,606
Loyalty, honor...

503
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,883
...a willing heart.

504
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,091
I can ask no more than that.

505
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,807
You don't have to do this.

506
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,850
You have a choice.

507
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,004
You've done honorably by our people.

508
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,640
You have built a new life
for us in the Blue Mountains.

509
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,969
A life of peace and plenty.

510
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,761
A life that is worth more
than all the gold in Erebor.

511
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:30,281
From my grandfather to my
father, this has come to me.

512
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,725
They dreamt of the day when the Dwarves
of Erebor would reclaim their homeland.

513
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,040
There is no choice, Balin.

514
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,090
Not for me.

515
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,129
Then we are with you, laddie.

516
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,361
We will see it done.

517
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:21,006
<i>Far over the misty mountains cold</i>

518
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,530
<i>To dungeons deep</i>

519
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,970
<i>And caverns old</i>

520
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,730
<i>We must away</i>

521
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,410
<i>'Ere break of day</i>

522
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:49,128
<i>To find our long-forgotten gold</i>

523
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:58,323
<i>The pines were roaring on the height</i>

524
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:07,130
<i>The winds were moaning in the night</i>

525
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:16,283
<i>The fire was red, it flaming spread</i>

526
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:24,800
<i>The trees like torches blazed with light</i>

527
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,889
Hello?

528
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,206
Yes.

529
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,200
Yes.

530
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,160
Here, Mr. Bilbo, where are you off to?

531
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,005
- Can't stop, I'm already late!
- Late for what?

532
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,284
I'm going on an adventure!

533
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,247
I said it. Didn't I say it?
Coming here was a waste of time.

534
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,004
That's true enough.

535
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,084
Ridiculous notion. Use
a Hobbit? A Half ling?

536
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,685
Whose idea was it anyway?

537
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,887
Wait!

538
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,807
Wait!

539
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,530
Whoa, whoa.

540
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,481
Whoa, whoa.

541
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,604
I signed it.

542
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,606
Here.

543
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,440
Everything appears to be in order.

544
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,001
Welcome, Master Baggins...

545
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,241
...to the company of Thorin Oakenshield.

546
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,761
Give him a pony.

547
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,804
No, no, that won't be necessary.

548
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,167
Thank you. I'm sure
I can keep up on foot.

549
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,926
I've done my fair share of
walking holidays, you know?

550
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,128
Even got as far as Frogmorton once. Aah!

551
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,883
Come on, Nori. Pay up.

552
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,002
One more. Thanks, lad.

553
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,730
What's that about?

554
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,448
Oh, they took wagers on
whether or not you'd turn up.

555
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,444
Most of them bet that you wouldn't.

556
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,410
And what did you think?

557
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,170
Well...

558
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,808
My dear fellow, I never
doubted you for a second.

559
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:40,605
It's horse hair. Having a reaction.

560
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,844
No, wait, wait, stop.

561
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,562
Stop! We have to turn around.

562
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,848
What on earth is the matter?

563
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,247
I forgot my handkerchief. Here.

564
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,967
Use this.

565
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,845
Move on.

566
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,844
<i>You'll have to manage without
pocket handkerchiefs...</i>

567
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,321
<i>...and a good many other
things, Bilbo Baggins...</i>

568
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,888
<i>...before we reach our journey's end.</i>

569
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:21,851
<i>You were born to the rolling hills
and little rivers of the Shire.</i>

570
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,810
<i>But home is now behind you.</i>

571
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:29,169
<i>The world is ahead.</i>

572
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,242
Hello, girl. Who's a good girl?

573
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,643
It's our little secret, Myrtle.

574
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,808
You must tell no one. Shh, shh.

575
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,601
What was that?

576
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,007
Orcs.

577
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,767
Orcs?

578
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,290
Throat-cutters. There'll
be dozens of them out there.

579
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,649
The lone-lands are crawling with them.

580
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,690
They strike in the wee small
hours when everyone's asleep.

581
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,003
Quick and quiet, no
screams. Just lots of blood.

582
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,289
You think that's funny?

583
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,567
You think a night
raid by Orcs is a joke?

584
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,771
We didn't mean anything by it.

585
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,724
No, you didn't.

586
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,367
You know nothing of the world.

587
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,241
Don't mind him, laddie.

588
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,122
Thorin has more cause
than most to hate Orcs.

589
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,009
After the dragon took
the Lonely Mountain...

590
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:25,008
...King Thror tried to reclaim
the ancient Dwarf kingdom of Moria.

591
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,282
<i>But our enemy had got there first.</i>

592
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,565
<i>Moria had been taken
by legions of Ores...</i>

593
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:51,448
<i>...led by the most
vile of all their race:</i>

594
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,049
<i>Azog the Defiler.</i>

595
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:00,051
<i>The giant Gundabad Orc...</i>

596
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:05,481
...had sworn to wipe
out the line of Durin.

597
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,444
He began...

598
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,409
...by beheading the king.

599
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,565
No!

600
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:34,727
Thrain, Thorin's father,
was driven mad by grief.

601
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,531
He went missing. Taken
prisoner or killed...

602
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,202
...we did not know.

603
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,565
We were leaderless.

604
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,847
<i>Defeat and death...</i>

605
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,843
<i>...were upon us.</i>

606
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,646
That is when I saw him.

607
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,609
A young Dwarf prince...

608
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,246
<i>...facing down the pale Orc.</i>

609
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:12,081
<i>He stood alone against
this terrible foe.</i>

610
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,450
<i>His armor rent...</i>

611
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:27,047
<i>...wielding nothing but an
oaken branch as a shield.</i>

612
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,768
<i>Azog the Defiler learned that day...</i>

613
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:49,769
...that the line of Durin
would not be so easily broken.

614
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,250
<i>Our forces rallied...</i>

615
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,920
<i>...and drove the Orcs back.</i>

616
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,091
<i>And our enemy...</i>

617
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,883
<i>...had been defeated.</i>

618
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,727
But there was no feast...

619
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:36,165
<i>...nor song that night...</i>

620
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:41,121
<i>...for our dead were
beyond the count of grief.</i>

621
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,568
<i>We few had survived.</i>

622
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,644
<i>And I thought to myself then...</i>

623
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,689
<i>...there is one who I could follow.</i>

624
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,048
There is one...

625
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,683
...I could call king.

626
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,006
And the pale Orc?

627
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,885
What happened to him?

628
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:37,601
He slunk back into the
hole whence he came.

629
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:41,647
That filth died of his wounds long ago.

630
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:31,361
Here, Mr. Gandalf, can't you
do something about this deluge?

631
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,401
It is raining, Master Dwarf...

632
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:38,281
...and it will continue to
rain until the rain is done.

633
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,965
If you wish to change the weather of the
world, you should find yourself another Wizard.

634
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,880
Are there any? What?

635
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,691
Other Wizards. There are five of us.

636
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:53,402
The greatest of our order
is Saruman the White.

637
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,006
Then there are the two Blue Wizards...

638
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,727
Do you know, I've quite
forgotten their names.

639
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,166
And who is the fifth?

640
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:06,291
Well, that would be Radagast the Brown.

641
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:10,206
Is he a great Wizard?
Or is he more like you?

642
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:17,002
I think he's a very great
Wizard, in his own way.

643
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,764
He's a gentle soul who prefers
the company of animals to others.

644
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,003
He keeps a watchful eye
over the vast forest lands...

645
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,731
<i>...to the east. And a good thing too.</i>

646
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:32,920
<i>For always evil will look to
find a foothold in this world.</i>

647
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,603
Not good. Not good at all.

648
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,326
Eww.

649
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,081
Oh, no. Sebastian.

650
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,847
Good gracious.

651
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,767
Come on.

652
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:39,089
Move back! Give him some
air, for goodness sake.

653
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,644
There. There.

654
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,645
I don't understand why it's not working.

655
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,246
It's not as if it's witchcraft.

656
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,567
Witchcraft.

657
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:07,725
Oh, but it is.

658
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:14,329
A dark and powerful magic.

659
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:50,728
Where on this good earth did
those foul creatures come from?

660
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,649
The old fortress?

661
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,361
Show me.

662
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,769
We'll camp here for the night.

663
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:36,603
Fili, Kili, look after the ponies.
Make sure you stay with them.

664
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:40,890
A farmer and his family
used to live here.

665
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,850
Oin, Gloin. Get a fire going. Aye.

666
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,047
Right you are.

667
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,841
I think it would be wiser to move on.

668
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:52,730
We could make for the Hidden Valley.

669
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,889
I have told you already...

670
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,923
...I will not go near that place.

671
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,407
Why not? The Elves could help us.

672
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,642
We could get food, rest, advice.

673
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,962
I do not need their advice.

674
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:08,170
We have a map that we cannot
read. Lord Elrond could help us.

675
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,685
Help?

676
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,842
A dragon attacks Erebor.

677
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,241
What help came from the Elves?

678
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,243
Orcs plunder Moria...

679
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,846
...desecrate our sacred halls.

680
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,890
The Elves looked on and did nothing.

681
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,930
And you ask me to seek out the very
people who betrayed my grandfather.

682
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,411
Who betrayed my father.

683
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,369
You are neither of them.

684
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,727
I did not give you that map and
key for you to hold onto the past.

685
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,928
I did not know that
they were yours to keep.

686
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,891
Everything all right?
Gandalf, where are you going?

687
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:51,442
To seek the company of the only
one around here who's got any sense.

688
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,285
And who's that? Myself, Mr. Baggins.

689
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:57,240
I've had enough of Dwarves for one day.

690
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,128
Come on, Bombur, we're hungry.

691
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,928
Is he coming back?

692
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,686
He's been a long time.

693
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,126
- Who?
- Gandalf.

694
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,482
He's a Wizard. He does as he chooses.

695
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:16,689
Here, do us a favor.
Take this to the lads.

696
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,805
Stop it. You've had plenty.

697
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,601
Aye, it's not a bad stew,
Bombur. I've had worse.

698
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,808
Dori could've
cooked it. Ha-ha-ha.

699
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,241
Hilarious.

700
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,246
What's the matter?

701
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:43,849
- We're supposed to be looking after the ponies.
- Only we've encountered a slight problem.

702
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,889
We had 16.

703
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:48,850
Now there's 14.

704
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,521
Daisy and Bungo are missing.

705
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,489
Well, that's not good. Ha, ha.

706
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,291
And that is not good at all.
Shouldn't we tell Thorin?

707
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,364
Uh, no. Let's not worry him.

708
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,763
As our official burglar, we thought
you might like to look into it.

709
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,325
Well, uh...

710
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:12,050
- Look, something big uprooted these trees.
- That was our thinking.

711
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:16,728
It's something very big and
possibly quite dangerous.

712
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:18,567
<i>Hey-</i>

713
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,730
There's a light.

714
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,765
Over here.

715
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,287
Stay down.

716
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,171
What is it?

717
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:34,771
Trolls.

718
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,127
Oh.

719
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,722
He's got Myrtle and Minty.

720
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:07,570
I think they're gonna eat
them. We have to do something.

721
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,529
Yes, you should.

722
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:13,805
Mountain Trolls are slow and stupid, and
you're so small, they'll never see you.

723
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,928
It's perfectly safe.
We'll be behind you.

724
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:19,721
If you run into trouble, hoot twice like
a barn owl and once like a brown owl.

725
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:22,850
Twice like a barn owl. No, twice
like a brown... Once like a...

726
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,968
Like a... Are you sure
this is a good idea?

727
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:28,409
Mutton yesterday, mutton today...

728
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:32,087
...and, blimey, if it don't
look like mutton again tomorrow.

729
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:35,162
Quit your griping.

730
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:39,564
These ain't sheep. These is fresh nags.

731
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:45,085
Oh! I don't like horse. I never
have. Not enough fat on them.

732
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,607
Well, it's better than
leathery old farmer.

733
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:52,129
All skin and bone, he was. I'm still
picking bits of him out of me teeth.

734
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:56,649
Well, that's lovely, that is. A floater.

735
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,723
Might improve the flavor.

736
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,486
Ah. There's more where that came from.

737
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:02,926
Oh, no, you don't! Ow!

738
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,763
Sit down!

739
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:21,130
Well, I hope you're
gonna gut these nags.

740
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,045
I don't like the stinky parts.

741
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:27,124
- Ow!
- I said sit down.

742
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,327
I'm starving!

743
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,609
Now, are we having
horse tonight or what?

744
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:35,810
Shut your cakehole.
You'll eat what I give you.

745
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:40,401
How come he's the cook?
Everything tastes the same.

746
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:42,130
Everything tastes like chicken.

747
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:43,526
Except the chicken.

748
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,011
What tastes like fish!

749
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:48,488
I'm just saying, a little
appreciation would be nice.

750
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:54,606
Oh. "Thank you very much,
Bert. Lovely stew, Bert. "

751
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:58,731
- How hard is that?
- Shh. Shh, shh. Shh.

752
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:02,010
Just needs a sprinkle of squirrel dung.

753
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:05,043
Here, that's my grog.

754
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:10,690
Sorry. Ow!

755
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:16,810
Ooh. That is beautifully
balanced, that is.

756
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,410
Wrap your laughing gear around that, eh?

757
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:22,407
Good, isn't it?

758
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,846
That's why I'm the cook.

759
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:38,844
Oh, me guts are grumbling.
I got to snaffle something.

760
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,731
Flesh, I need flesh. Ah! Ah!

761
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:46,287
Blimey!

762
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,930
Bert. Bert! Look what's
come out of me hooter.

763
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,208
It's got arms and legs and everything.

764
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,005
What is it?

765
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,845
I don't know. But I don't like
the way it wriggles around.

766
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:04,049
What are you, then?
An oversized squirrel?

767
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,924
I'm a burglar... Uh, Hobbit.

768
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:08,208
A burglar Hobbit?

769
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,964
Can we cook him?

770
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,686
We can try.

771
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,562
He wouldn't make more than a mouthful.

772
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:20,530
Not when he's skinned and boned.

773
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:23,684
Perhaps there's more burglar
Hobbits around these parts.

774
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:26,929
Might be enough for a pie.

775
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,162
Grab him! He's too quick.

776
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:32,688
Right. Come here, you little...

777
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,001
Gotcha.

778
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:38,001
Are there any more of you little
fellas hiding where you shouldn't?

779
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,764
No.

780
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,365
He's lying.

781
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:45,844
- No, I'm not!
- Hold his toes over the fire.

782
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,731
Make him squeal!

783
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,247
Drop him!

784
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:54,811
You what?

785
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,090
I said...

786
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,407
...drop him.

787
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:25,041
Get the sacks! Stick them in the sacks!

788
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,810
Ow!

789
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,562
Come on! Get up!

790
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,171
- Bilbo!
- Don't!

791
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,762
Lay down your arms...

792
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,249
...or we'll rip his off.

793
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,882
Oh! That's hot, that's hot, that's hot!

794
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:42,690
Don't bother cooking them.

795
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:47,084
Let's just sit on them
and squash them into jelly.

796
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:51,484
They should be sauteed and
grilled with a sprinkle of sage.

797
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:53,210
Is this really necessary?

798
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:55,169
That does sound quite nice.

799
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:57,721
Untie me, mister. Eat
someone your own size.

800
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,363
Never mind the seasoning.

801
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:02,329
We ain't got all night.

802
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:05,802
Dawn ain't far away.
Let's get a move on.

803
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,401
I don't fancy being turned to stone.

804
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:12,451
Wait!

805
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:15,683
You are making a terrible mistake.

806
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:18,047
You can't reason with
them. They're half-wits!

807
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,282
Half-wits? What does that make us?

808
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,730
I meant with the seasoning.

809
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:26,691
What about the seasoning?

810
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,080
Well, have you smelt them?

811
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:31,967
You're gonna need something stronger
than sage before you plate this lot up.

812
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:35,283
Traitor!
- What do you know about cooking Dwarf?

813
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:36,847
Shut up.

814
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:40,841
Let the flurgaburburhobbit talk.

815
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:44,684
The secret to cooking Dwarf is...

816
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:48,003
Yes? Come on. Tell us the secret.
- It's, uh...

817
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,208
Yes, I'm telling you. The secret is...

818
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:54,489
...to skin them first.

819
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,563
What? Skin us?

820
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:59,286
Tom, get me filleting knife.

821
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,124
I'll skin you, you little...!

822
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,169
I won't forget that. I won't forget it.

823
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:05,687
What a load of rubbish.

824
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:08,764
I've eaten plenty with their skins on.

825
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:11,321
Scarf them, I say, boots and all.

826
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,241
He's right.

827
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,006
Nothing wrong with a bit of raw Dwarf.

828
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,927
Nice and crunchy.

829
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,806
Oh, not that one. He's infected.

830
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:26,724
- Huh?
- You what?

831
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:31,044
Yeah, he's got worms in his tubes.

832
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,168
Eww! Aah!

833
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:36,722
In fact, they all have.
They're infested with parasites.

834
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:39,850
It's a terrible business. I
wouldn't risk it. I really wouldn't.

835
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,889
Parasites? Did he say "parasites"?

836
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,850
We don't have parasites.
You have parasites!

837
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,523
What are you talking about, laddie?

838
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,929
I've got parasites as big as my arm.

839
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:55,686
Mine are the biggest parasites.
I've got huge parasites.

840
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,210
We're riddled. Yes, I'm riddled.

841
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:00,646
Yes, we are, badly.

842
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:03,690
What would you have us do, then?

843
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:05,410
Let them all go?

844
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:09,128
- Well...
- You think I don't know what you're up to?

845
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:13,605
This little ferret is
taking us for fools.

846
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:15,605
- Ferret?
- Fools?

847
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:18,770
The dawn will take you all.

848
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,810
- Who's that?
- No idea.

849
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,086
Can we eat him too?

850
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:51,766
Get your foot out of my back.

851
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,046
Ah.

852
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,442
Where did you go to, if I may ask?

853
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:05,290
To look ahead.

854
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:08,524
- What brought you back?
- Looking behind.

855
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:10,726
Nasty business.

856
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,370
Still, they're all in one piece.

857
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:14,050
No thanks to your burglar.

858
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,602
He had the nous to play for time.

859
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,401
None of the rest of you thought of that.

860
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:26,404
They must have come
down from the Ettenmoors.

861
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,370
Since when do Mountain
Trolls venture this far south?

862
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,602
Ooh. Not for an age.

863
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,722
Not since a darker
power ruled these lands.

864
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:45,247
They could not have moved in daylight.

865
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:48,167
There must be a cave nearby.

866
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:01,087
Oh, what's that stench?

867
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:04,443
It's a Troll-hoard.

868
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,406
Be careful what you touch.

869
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:22,929
Seems a shame just to
leave it lying around.

870
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:26,971
- Anyone could take it.
- Agreed.

871
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,804
Nori. Yeah?

872
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,325
Get a shovel.

873
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,648
These swords were not made by any Troll.

874
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:59,929
Nor were they made by
any smith among Men.

875
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,682
These were forged in Gondolin...

876
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:10,322
...by the High Elves of the First Age.

877
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:13,047
You could not wish for a finer blade.

878
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,843
Set it down. That's good.

879
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,484
All right, come on. Quick.

880
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:42,485
We're making a long-term deposit.

881
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:44,690
Let's get out of this foul place.

882
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:46,844
Come on, let's go.

883
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,968
Bofur, Gloin, Nori.

884
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:10,204
Bilbo. Hmm?

885
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:12,687
Here.

886
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:15,411
This is about your size.

887
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:22,445
I can't take this.

888
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:24,842
The blade is of Elvish make...

889
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:29,961
...which means it will glow blue
when Orcs or Goblins are nearby.

890
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,441
I have never used a sword in my life.

891
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:35,642
And I hope you never have to.

892
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,210
But if you do, remember this:

893
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:44,931
True courage is about knowing
not when to take a life...

894
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,807
...but when to spare one.

895
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:54,685
Something's coming!

896
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,968
Gandalf. Stay together!

897
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:01,202
Hurry now! Arm yourselves!

898
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,368
Thieves! Fire! Murder!

899
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:25,929
Radagast.

900
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,403
It's Radagast the Brown.

901
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,244
Well...

902
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,164
What on earth are you doing here?

903
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,845
I was looking for you, Gandalf.

904
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,411
Something's wrong.

905
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:39,688
Something's terribly wrong.

906
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,080
Yes?

907
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:44,760
Oh.

908
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,403
Just give me a minute.

909
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:51,604
Oh. I had a thought
and now I've lost it.

910
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:55,202
It was right there on
the tip of my tongue.

911
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,969
Oh. It's not a thought at all.

912
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,202
It's a silly old...

913
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,962
...stick insect.

914
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:11,606
The Greenwood is sick, Gandalf.

915
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:14,287
A darkness has fallen over it.

916
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:16,488
Nothing grows anymore.

917
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:18,888
At least, nothing good.

918
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:21,731
The air is foul with decay.

919
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:23,689
But worse are the webs.

920
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,047
Webs? What do you mean?

921
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:28,328
Spiders, Gandalf.

922
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:29,925
Giant ones.

923
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:34,404
Some kind of spawn of
Ungoliant, or I am not a Wizard.

924
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,848
I followed their trail.

925
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,844
They came from Dol Guldur.

926
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,405
Huh?

927
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,762
Dol Guldur?

928
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:48,129
But the old fortress is abandoned.

929
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,764
No, Gandalf.

930
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:54,083
<i>“Us not.</i>

931
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:05,164
<i>RADAGAST". A dark
power dwells in there...</i>

932
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:09,041
<i>...such as I have never felt before.</i>

933
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:14,889
<i>It is the shadow of an ancient horror.</i>

934
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:24,282
<i>One that can summon the spirits...</i>

935
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:27,088
<i>...of the dead.</i>

936
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:44,485
<i>I saw him, Gandalf.</i>

937
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:48,291
<i>From out of the darkness...</i>

938
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:51,843
<i>...a Necromancer has come.</i>

939
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,927
Radagast.

940
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:02,089
Quick! Quick, quick! Quick, quick!

941
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,644
Wait for me!

942
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:21,566
Sorry.

943
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:24,166
Try a little Old Toby.

944
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:25,845
It'll help settle your nerves.

945
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:30,487
And out.

946
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:42,768
Now, a Necromancer. Are you sure?

947
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:57,850
That is not...

948
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,085
...from the world of the living.

949
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:10,805
Was that a wolf? Are
there wolves out there?

950
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,924
Wolves? No, that is not a wolf.

951
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:20,845
Kili! Get your bow!

952
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:29,610
Warg scouts.

953
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,923
- Which means an Orc pack is not far behind.
- Orc pack?

954
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:35,924
Who did you tell about
your quest beyond your kin?

955
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,923
- No one.
- Who did you tell?

956
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:39,445
No one, I swear.

957
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:41,924
What in Durin's name is going on?

958
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:43,320
You are being hunted.

959
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:47,364
- We have to get out of here.
- We can't. We have no ponies.

960
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,450
They bolted.

961
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,011
I'll draw them off.

962
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:55,084
These are Gundabad Wargs.
They will outrun you.

963
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:57,163
These are Rhosgobel rabbits.

964
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:01,563
I'd like to see them try.

965
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:12,367
Come on! Come on!

966
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:14,881
Come and get me! Ha, ha!

967
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:25,844
Come on.

968
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:54,841
Stay together.

969
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,047
Move!

970
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,726
Ori, no! Get back.

971
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:14,285
All of you, come on. Quick!

972
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,443
Where are you leading us?

973
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:29,086
Move!

974
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,486
Run!

975
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:49,010
There they are!

976
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,921
This way! Quickly!

977
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:05,725
There's more coming!

978
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:09,963
Kili! Shoot them!

979
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,364
We're surrounded!

980
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:21,130
Where's Gandalf?

981
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,442
He's abandoned us.

982
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:31,841
Hold your ground!

983
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:42,446
This way, you fools!

984
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:44,561
Come on, move!

985
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:48,809
Quickly! All of you!

986
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,411
Come on!

987
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:52,285
Go, go, go!

988
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,809
Eight, nine, 10.

989
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:08,208
Kili! Run!

990
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:49,646
Elves.

991
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:56,485
I cannot see where the pathway
leads. Do we follow it or no?

992
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:58,643
Follow it, of course.

993
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,962
I think that would be wise.

994
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,289
Come on now, brother.

995
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:05,002
The Valley of Imladris.

996
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:09,451
In the common tongue,
it's known by another name.

997
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:11,728
Rivendell.

998
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:18,967
Here lies the Last Homely
House East of the Sea.

999
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:22,806
This was your plan all along.

1000
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:25,368
To seek refuge with our enemy.

1001
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:28,888
You have no enemies
here, Thorin Oakenshield.

1002
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:32,971
The only ill will to be found in this
valley is that which you bring yourself.

1003
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:37,483
You think the Elves will
give our quest their blessing?

1004
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:40,051
They will try to stop us.

1005
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:44,251
Of course they will. But we have
questions that need to be answered.

1006
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:51,367
If we are to be successful, this
will need to be handled with tact.

1007
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:52,931
And respect.

1008
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:55,560
And no small degree of charm.

1009
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:59,805
<i>Which is why you will
leave the talking to me.</i>

1010
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:58,004
Mithrandir.

1011
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:01,331
Ah. Lindir.

1012
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,045
Stay sharp.

1013
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,403
I must speak with Lord Elrond.

1014
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:10,523
My Lord Elrond is not here.

1015
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:12,764
Not here?

1016
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:14,767
Where is he?

1017
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:31,210
Close ranks!

1018
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:58,602
- Gandalf.
- Lord Elrond.

1019
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:19,490
Strange for Orcs to come
so close to our borders.

1020
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:23,645
Something or someone
has drawn them near.

1021
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:26,087
That may have been us.

1022
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:34,482
Welcome, Thorin, son of Thrain.

1023
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:37,086
I do not believe we have met.

1024
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:40,609
You have your grandfather's bearing.

1025
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:43,286
I knew Thror when he
ruled Under the Mountain.

1026
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:46,762
Indeed? He made no mention of you.

1027
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:00,207
What is he saying?

1028
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:02,846
Does he offer us insult?

1029
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,686
No, Master Gloin,
he's offering you food.

1030
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:16,967
Well, in that case, lead on.

1031
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:19,007
Hey. Come on.

1032
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:22,124
Try it. Just a mouthful.

1033
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:23,884
I don't like green food.

1034
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:26,087
Where's the meat?

1035
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:29,210
Have they got any chips?

1036
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:32,687
Kind of you to invite us.

1037
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:34,410
Not really dressed for dinner.

1038
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:35,840
Well, you never are.

1039
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:00,645
This is Orcrist, the Goblin-cleaver.

1040
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:02,450
A famous blade...

1041
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:08,482
...forged by the High
Elves of the West, my kin.

1042
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:10,563
May it serve you well.

1043
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:13,161
<i>And this is Glamdring...</i>

1044
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:18,686
...the Foehammer. Sword
of the King of Gondolin.

1045
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:21,241
These were made for the
Goblin Wars of the First Age.

1046
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:26,367
I wouldn't bother, laddie. Swords are
named for the great deeds they do in war.

1047
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:28,761
What are you saying, my
sword hasn't seen battle?

1048
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:31,322
I'm not actually sure it is a sword.

1049
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:34,643
More of a letter opener, really.

1050
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:37,165
How did you come by these?

1051
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:40,290
We found them in a Troll-hoard
on the Great East Road...

1052
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:44,403
...shortly before we
were ambushed by Orcs.

1053
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:49,168
And what were you doing
on the Great East Road?

1054
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:52,322
Our business is no concern of Elves.

1055
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:55,450
For goodness sake,
Thorin, show him the map.

1056
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:57,688
It is the legacy of my people.

1057
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:01,401
It is mine to protect,
as are its secrets.

1058
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:04,126
Save me from the
stubbornness of Dwarves.

1059
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:07,250
Your pride will be your downfall.

1060
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:10,330
You stand in the presence of
one of the few in Middle-earth...

1061
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:14,166
...who can read that map.
Show it to Lord Elrond.

1062
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:23,049
Thorin, no.

1063
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:34,044
Erebor.

1064
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:39,121
What is your interest in this map?

1065
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:41,886
It's mainly academic.

1066
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:47,361
As you know, this sort of artifact
sometimes contains hidden text.

1067
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:55,525
You still read ancient
Dwarvish, do you not?

1068
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:06,086
Moon runes?

1069
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:07,924
Of course.

1070
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:10,649
An easy thing to miss.

1071
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:12,410
Well, in this case, that is true.

1072
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:15,086
Moon runes can only be read
by the light of a moon...

1073
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:19,689
...of the same shape and season as
the day on which they were written.

1074
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,244
Can you read them?

1075
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:29,923
These runes were written
on a Midsummer's Eve...

1076
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:34,369
...by the light of a crescent
moon nearly 200 years ago.

1077
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,810
It would seem you were
meant to come to Rivendell.

1078
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:40,722
Fate is with you, Thorin Oakenshield.

1079
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:44,771
The same moon shines upon us tonight.

1080
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:08,168
"Stand by the gray stone
when the thrush knocks...

1081
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:13,087
...and the setting sun with
the last light of Durin's Day...

1082
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:17,643
- ... will shine upon the keyhole. "
- Durin's Day?

1083
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:21,282
It is the start of the Dwarves' new
year, when the last moon of autumn...

1084
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:24,330
...and the first sun of winter
appear in the sky together.

1085
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,403
This is ill news.

1086
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:29,131
Summer is passing. Durin's
Day will soon be upon us.

1087
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:30,566
We still have time.

1088
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:33,200
- Time? For what?
- To find the entrance.

1089
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:37,160
We have to be standing in exactly the
right spot at exactly the right time.

1090
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:41,325
Then, and only then,
can the door be opened.

1091
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:44,848
So this is your purpose,
to enter the mountain?

1092
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:47,091
What of it?

1093
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:50,210
There are some who
would not deem it wise.

1094
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:52,921
What do you mean?

1095
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:58,968
You are not the only guardian
to stand watch over Middle-earth.

1096
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:41,807
AZOG

1097
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:51,449
No, you did the same thing.

1098
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:55,929
- It's not like you didn't
do it. Dori! Here, take that.

1099
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:02,804
Bombur!

1100
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:13,130
With or without our help, these
Dwarves will march on the mountain.

1101
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:16,204
They're determined to
reclaim their homeland.

1102
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:21,526
I do not believe Thorin Oakenshield
feels that he is answerable to anyone.

1103
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:23,409
Nor, for that matter, am I.

1104
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:27,406
It is not me you must answer to.

1105
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:41,002
Lady Galadriel.

1106
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:43,681
Mithrandir.

1107
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:05,806
I had no idea Lord
Elrond had sent for you.

1108
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:07,564
He didn't.

1109
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:09,843
I did.

1110
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:16,326
Ah.

1111
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:19,569
Saruman.

1112
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:24,203
You've been busy of late, my friend.

1113
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:26,767
Tell me, Gandalf...

1114
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:32,609
...did you think these plans and
schemes of yours would go unnoticed?

1115
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:34,728
Unnoticed?

1116
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:36,805
No.

1117
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,651
I'm simply doing what
I feel to be right.

1118
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:43,088
The dragon has long been on your mind.

1119
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:45,562
That is true, my lady.

1120
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:48,127
Smaug owes allegiance to no one.

1121
01:35:48,280 --> 01:35:51,124
But if he should side with the enemy...

1122
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:54,204
...a dragon could be
used to terrible effect.

1123
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:55,930
What enemy?

1124
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:59,524
Gandalf, the enemy is defeated.

1125
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:04,402
Sauron is vanquished. He can
never regain his full strength.

1126
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:09,931
Gandalf, for 400 years
we have lived in peace...

1127
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:12,970
...a hard-won, watchful peace.

1128
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:16,130
Are we? Are we at peace?

1129
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:19,601
Trolls have come down
from the mountains.

1130
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:22,240
They are raiding
villages, destroying farms.

1131
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:24,687
Orcs have attacked us on the road.

1132
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:26,689
Hardly a prelude to war.

1133
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:29,121
Always you must meddle...

1134
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:31,282
...looking for trouble
where none exists.

1135
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:33,841
Let him speak.

1136
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:39,721
There is something at work
beyond the evil of Smaug.

1137
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:42,360
Something far more powerful.

1138
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:48,524
We can remain blind to it, but it will
not be ignoring us, that I can promise you.

1139
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:51,524
A sickness lies over the Greenwood.

1140
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:54,081
The woodsmen who live
there now call it Mirkwood.

1141
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:56,089
And they say...

1142
01:36:58,440 --> 01:37:01,171
Well? Don't stop now.

1143
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:03,641
Tell us what the woodsmen say.

1144
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:07,122
They speak of a Necromancer
living in Dol Guldur.

1145
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:10,762
A sorcerer who can summon the dead.

1146
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:12,331
That's absurd.

1147
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:15,324
No such power exists in this world.

1148
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:19,610
This Necromancer is nothing
more than a mortal man.

1149
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:22,400
A conjurer dabbling in black magic.

1150
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:24,204
And so I thought too.

1151
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:27,802
But Radagast has seen... Radagast?

1152
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:31,402
Do not speak to me
of Radagast the Brown.

1153
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:33,403
He's a foolish fellow.

1154
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:37,770
Well, he's odd, I grant you.
He lives a solitary life.

1155
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:42,323
It's not that. It's his excessive
consumption of mushrooms.

1156
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:46,925
They've addled his brain
and yellowed his teeth.

1157
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:48,731
I've warned him.

1158
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:52,208
It is unbefitting one of the
Istari to be wandering the woods...

1159
01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:55,011
You carry something.

1160
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:59,130
<i>It came to you from Radagast.</i>

1161
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:02,807
<i>He found it in Dol Guldur.</i>

1162
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:04,849
<i>Yes.</i>

1163
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:07,888
Show me.

1164
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:10,601
...listen to me.

1165
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:14,600
I would think I was talking to myself
for all the attention that he paid.

1166
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:17,081
By all means...

1167
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:20,729
What is that?

1168
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:23,611
A relic of Mordor.

1169
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:36,088
A Morgul Blade.

1170
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:39,403
Made for the Witchking of Angmar.

1171
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:43,082
And buried with him.

1172
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:46,928
When Angmar fell...

1173
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:50,607
...the Men of the North took his
body and all that he possessed...

1174
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:53,889
...and sealed it within
the High Fells of Rhudaur.

1175
01:38:54,120 --> 01:38:57,044
Deep within the rock they buried him...

1176
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:01,003
...in a tomb so dark...

1177
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:02,804
...it would never come to light.

1178
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:05,486
This is not possible.

1179
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:08,851
A powerful spell lies upon those tombs.

1180
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:10,929
They cannot be opened.

1181
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:15,927
What proof do we have this
weapon came from Angmar's grave?

1182
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:19,325
- I have none.
- Because there is none.

1183
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:22,444
Let us examine what we know.

1184
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:25,447
A single Orc pack...

1185
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:27,927
...has dared to cross the Bruinen.

1186
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:31,803
A dagger from a bygone
age has been found.

1187
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:37,330
And a human sorcerer who calls
himself "The Necromancer"...

1188
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:41,730
...has taken up residence
in a ruined fortress.

1189
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:46,291
It's not so very much after all.

1190
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:51,480
The question of this Dwarvish
company, however, troubles me deeply.

1191
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:53,369
I'm not convinced, Gandalf.

1192
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:57,002
I do not feel I can
condone such a quest.

1193
01:39:57,440 --> 01:40:01,729
If they'd come to me, I might have
spared them this disappointment.

1194
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:04,963
I do not pretend to understand
your reason for raising their hopes.

1195
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:06,770
<i>They are leaving.</i>

1196
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:10,805
<i>Yes.</i>

1197
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:14,564
You knew.

1198
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:22,569
No, I'm afraid there
is nothing else for it.

1199
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,164
My Lord Elrond.

1200
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:29,450
The Dwarves, they're gone.

1201
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:36,643
Be on your guard.

1202
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:39,161
We're about to step over
the Edge of the Wild.

1203
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:42,081
Balin, you know these paths. Lead on.

1204
01:40:42,240 --> 01:40:43,844
Aye.

1205
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:51,488
Master Baggins...

1206
01:40:51,640 --> 01:40:53,961
...I suggest you keep up.

1207
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:10,286
You Will follow them. Yes.

1208
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:13,569
You are right to help
Thorin Oakenshield.

1209
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:17,008
But I fear this quest
has set in motion...

1210
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:20,687
...forces we do not yet understand.

1211
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:24,805
The riddle of the Morgul
Blade must be answered.

1212
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:28,487
Something moves in the shadows
unseen, hidden from our sight.

1213
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:30,728
It will not show itself.

1214
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:32,689
Not yet.

1215
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:35,684
But every day it grows in strength.

1216
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:37,808
You must be careful.

1217
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:44,004
Mithrandir?

1218
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:47,802
Why the Half ling?

1219
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:51,722
I do not know.

1220
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:58,080
Saruman believes that
it is only great power...

1221
01:41:58,240 --> 01:42:01,403
...that can hold evil in check.

1222
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:04,131
But that is not what I have found.

1223
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:08,961
I have found it is the small things...

1224
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:11,521
...everyday deeds of ordinary folk...

1225
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:14,843
...that keeps the darkness at bay.

1226
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:18,842
Simple acts of kindness and love.

1227
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:23,730
Why Bilbo Baggins?

1228
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:28,571
Perhaps it is because I'm afraid...

1229
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:32,881
...and he gives me courage.

1230
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:41,082
Do not be afraid, Mithrandir.

1231
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:44,205
You are not alone.

1232
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:27,165
Hey! Hold on!

1233
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:35,562
Aah! Bilbo!

1234
01:44:38,160 --> 01:44:41,130
We must find shelter!

1235
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:42,691
Look out!

1236
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:49,964
Look out, brother!

1237
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:52,330
Hold on!

1238
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:57,804
This is no thunderstorm.

1239
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:00,891
It's a thunder-battle!

1240
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:03,409
Look!

1241
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:09,722
Well, bless me.

1242
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:11,689
The legends are true.

1243
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:15,811
Giants! Stone-Giants!

1244
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:25,006
Take cover, you fool!

1245
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:27,564
Hold on!

1246
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:38,451
What's happening? Grab my hand!

1247
01:46:02,240 --> 01:46:05,244
Go, go, go! Run! Get off! Get off!

1248
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:12,171
Run! Look out!

1249
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:18,645
Look out!

1250
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:40,564
Jump!

1251
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:41,841
Come on!

1252
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:47,371
Hold on!

1253
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:59,331
No!

1254
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:10,606
No! Kili!

1255
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:18,721
It's all right! They're alive!

1256
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:22,801
Where's Bilbo? Where's the Hobbit?

1257
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:25,606
There!

1258
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:30,005
Get him!

1259
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:31,881
Aah!

1260
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:34,367
- Grab my hand!
- Bilbo!

1261
01:47:35,680 --> 01:47:38,160
Ori, be careful! Take it!

1262
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:40,846
I've got you, lad. Grab on! Grab on!

1263
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,844
Come on. Get him.

1264
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,684
Come on, lad. Up you get.

1265
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:01,287
I thought we'd lost our burglar.

1266
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:04,331
He's been lost ever since he left home.

1267
01:48:05,160 --> 01:48:07,049
He should never have come.

1268
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:09,123
He has no place amongst us.

1269
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:12,724
Dwalin!

1270
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:21,286
It looks safe enough.
Search to the back.

1271
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:24,525
Caves in the mountain
are seldom unoccupied.

1272
01:48:28,040 --> 01:48:30,008
There's nothing here.

1273
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:33,962
Right, then. Let's get a fire started.

1274
01:48:34,120 --> 01:48:37,044
No. No fires. Not in this place.

1275
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:38,929
Get some sleep.

1276
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:41,606
We start at first light.

1277
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:45,481
We were to wait in the mountains
until Gandalf joined us.

1278
01:48:45,640 --> 01:48:48,610
- That was the plan.
- Plans change.

1279
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:52,287
Bofur, take the first watch.

1280
01:50:06,640 --> 01:50:08,404
Where do you think you're going?

1281
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:12,806
Back to Rivendell.

1282
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,241
No, no, you can't turn back now, eh?

1283
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:19,404
You're part of the
company. You're one of us.

1284
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:21,528
I'm not, though, am I?

1285
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:26,208
Thorin said I should never
have come and he was right.

1286
01:50:26,360 --> 01:50:30,490
I'm not a Took, I'm a Baggins.
I don't know what I was thinking.

1287
01:50:31,720 --> 01:50:35,770
- I should never have run out my door.
- You're homesick. I understand.

1288
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:38,446
No, you don't. You don't
understand. None of you do.

1289
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:41,365
You're Dwarves. You're
used to this life.

1290
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:45,286
To living on the road, never settling
in one place, not belonging anywhere!

1291
01:50:49,400 --> 01:50:50,925
Oh, I am sorry. I didn't...

1292
01:50:56,600 --> 01:50:58,409
No, you're right.

1293
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:03,648
We don't belong anywhere.

1294
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:14,081
I wish you all the luck in the world.

1295
01:51:17,320 --> 01:51:19,049
I really do.

1296
01:51:23,160 --> 01:51:24,605
What's that?

1297
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:28,211
Hmm?

1298
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:49,122
Wake up! Wake up!

1299
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:50,407
Whoa!

1300
01:52:13,120 --> 01:52:14,770
Look out! Look out!

1301
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:19,690
Get away!

1302
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:25,285
Filthy scum!

1303
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:27,522
Get back!

1304
01:52:31,240 --> 01:52:33,163
You'll pay for this!

1305
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:41,602
Got you.

1306
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:44,371
All right, all right. Don't push.

1307
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:48,924
Get off! Get your hands
off me! Get off me!

1308
01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:56,482
Get off me!

1309
01:54:43,400 --> 01:54:48,850
Who would be so bold as to
come armed into my kingdom?

1310
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:52,527
Spies? Thieves? Assassins?

1311
01:54:52,680 --> 01:54:54,409
Dwarves, Your Malevolence.

1312
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:56,324
Dwarves?

1313
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:58,244
We found them on the Front Porch.

1314
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:02,724
Well, don't just stand
there. Search them.

1315
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:05,486
Every crack. Every crevice.

1316
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:13,407
What are you doing in these parts?

1317
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:16,801
Speak!

1318
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:23,964
Very well. If they will not
talk, we'll make them squawk.

1319
01:55:24,120 --> 01:55:25,690
Bring up the mangler.

1320
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:28,684
Bring up the bonebreaker.

1321
01:55:28,840 --> 01:55:31,889
Start with the youngest. Wait!

1322
01:55:34,480 --> 01:55:37,768
Well, well, well.

1323
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:40,446
Look who it is.

1324
01:55:41,200 --> 01:55:44,682
Thorin, son of Thrain, son of Thror...

1325
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:48,563
...King Under the Mountain.

1326
01:55:49,400 --> 01:55:53,405
Oh, but I'm forgetting.
You don't have a mountain.

1327
01:55:53,560 --> 01:55:55,210
And you're not a king...

1328
01:55:55,360 --> 01:55:59,729
...which makes you nobody, really.

1329
01:56:03,120 --> 01:56:07,967
I know someone who would pay
a pretty price for your head.

1330
01:56:08,840 --> 01:56:10,763
Just a head.

1331
01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:12,649
Nothing attached.

1332
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:17,561
Perhaps you know of whom I speak.

1333
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:20,485
An old enemy of yours.

1334
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:27,442
A pale Orc, astride a white Warg.

1335
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:32,202
Azog the Defiler was destroyed.

1336
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:36,847
He was slain in battle long ago.

1337
01:56:37,080 --> 01:56:40,880
So you think his defiling
days are done, do you?

1338
01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:45,366
Send word to the pale Orc.

1339
01:56:45,560 --> 01:56:49,042
Tell him I have found his prize.

1340
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:27,161
Yes!

1341
01:57:28,920 --> 01:57:30,331
Yes.

1342
01:57:31,480 --> 01:57:34,131
Yes.

1343
01:57:35,320 --> 01:57:37,846
Yes!

1344
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:39,889
Gollum, gollum!

1345
01:58:04,360 --> 01:58:05,805
Aah!

1346
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:11,603
Nasty Goblinses!

1347
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:15,091
Better than old bones, precious.

1348
01:58:15,240 --> 01:58:17,163
Better than nothing.

1349
01:58:45,560 --> 01:58:50,327
Too many boneses,
precious. Not enough flesh!

1350
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:54,121
Shut up! Cut its skin off.

1351
01:58:55,040 --> 01:58:57,407
Start with its head.

1352
01:59:02,280 --> 01:59:06,001
<i>The cold hard lands They bites our hands</i>

1353
01:59:06,200 --> 01:59:09,522
<i>They gnaws our feet</i>

1354
01:59:09,680 --> 01:59:13,287
<i>The rocks and stones
They're like old bones</i>

1355
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:16,603
<i>All bare of meat</i>

1356
01:59:16,760 --> 01:59:19,684
<i>Cold as death Without no breath</i>

1357
01:59:19,880 --> 01:59:22,201
<i>It's good to eat</i>

1358
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:04,442
Bless us and splash us, precious.

1359
02:00:04,600 --> 02:00:07,251
That's a meaty mouthful.

1360
02:00:09,120 --> 02:00:11,805
Gollum, gollum! Aah.

1361
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:15,401
Back. Stay back.

1362
02:00:15,600 --> 02:00:20,049
I'm warning you, don't come any closer.

1363
02:00:20,920 --> 02:00:25,801
It's got an Elfish blade.
But it's not an Elfs.

1364
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:29,042
Not an Elfs, no.

1365
02:00:29,240 --> 02:00:30,969
What is it, precious?

1366
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:33,525
What is it?

1367
02:00:33,680 --> 02:00:37,162
My name is Bilbo Baggins.

1368
02:00:38,120 --> 02:00:40,202
Bagginses?

1369
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:44,247
What is a Bagginses, precious?

1370
02:00:44,720 --> 02:00:48,805
- I'm a Hobbit from the Shire.
- Oh.

1371
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:54,285
We like Goblinses, batses and fishes.
But we hasn't tried Hobbitses before.

1372
02:00:55,480 --> 02:00:58,450
Is it soft? Is it juicy?

1373
02:00:58,640 --> 02:01:02,201
Now, now, keep your distance!

1374
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:04,368
I'll use this if I have to.

1375
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:05,561
Aah!

1376
02:01:05,720 --> 02:01:08,530
I don't want any trouble,
do you understand?

1377
02:01:08,680 --> 02:01:11,763
Just show me the way to get out
of here and I'll be on my way.

1378
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:13,843
Why? Is it lost?

1379
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:17,891
Yes. Yes, and I want to get
unlost as soon as possible.

1380
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:21,004
Ooh, we knows! We knows
safe paths for Hobbitses.

1381
02:01:21,160 --> 02:01:23,242
Safe paths in the dark.

1382
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:24,731
Shut up!

1383
02:01:24,920 --> 02:01:27,890
- I didn't say anything.
- We wasn't talking to you.

1384
02:01:28,040 --> 02:01:30,805
Oh, yes, we was, precious. We was.

1385
02:01:31,160 --> 02:01:34,323
Look, I don't know what
your game is, but I...

1386
02:01:34,480 --> 02:01:36,050
Games?!

1387
02:01:36,200 --> 02:01:39,044
Oh, we love games, doesn't we, precious?

1388
02:01:39,200 --> 02:01:43,728
Does it like games? Does it,
does it? Does it like to play?

1389
02:01:44,280 --> 02:01:45,611
Maybe.

1390
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:52,448
<i>What has roots as nobody sees?</i>

1391
02:01:52,600 --> 02:01:55,365
<i>Is taller than trees?</i>

1392
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:57,602
<i>UP, up, up it goes</i>

1393
02:01:57,760 --> 02:02:00,684
<i>And yet, never grows</i>

1394
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:04,331
- The mountain.
- Yes, yes.

1395
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:07,689
Oh, let's have another one, eh?

1396
02:02:07,880 --> 02:02:11,282
Yes! Do it again, do it again. Ask us.

1397
02:02:11,440 --> 02:02:14,489
No! No more riddles.

1398
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:17,724
Finish him off. Finish him now!

1399
02:02:17,880 --> 02:02:19,405
Gollum, gollum!

1400
02:02:19,600 --> 02:02:21,329
No!No. No.

1401
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:24,604
No. I want to play. I do.

1402
02:02:24,840 --> 02:02:27,446
I want to play. I can see...

1403
02:02:27,600 --> 02:02:31,321
...you are very good at this.

1404
02:02:31,960 --> 02:02:33,689
So why don't we...

1405
02:02:35,640 --> 02:02:37,927
...have a game of riddles? Yes?

1406
02:02:38,120 --> 02:02:39,770
Just you and me.

1407
02:02:40,280 --> 02:02:44,444
Yes. Yes, just us.

1408
02:02:44,600 --> 02:02:46,648
Yes. Yes.

1409
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:49,007
And if I win...

1410
02:02:49,160 --> 02:02:52,164
...you show me the way out. Yes?

1411
02:02:52,320 --> 02:02:54,084
Yes. Yes.

1412
02:02:54,880 --> 02:02:57,963
And if it loses? What then?

1413
02:02:58,120 --> 02:03:01,602
Well, if it loses,
precious, then we eats it!

1414
02:03:02,840 --> 02:03:06,481
If Baggins loses, we eats it whole.

1415
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:14,684
Fair enough.

1416
02:03:18,920 --> 02:03:20,445
Well, Baggins first.

1417
02:03:27,240 --> 02:03:29,766
<i>Thirty white horses on a red hill</i>

1418
02:03:30,520 --> 02:03:33,364
<i>First they champ, then they stamp</i>

1419
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:35,124
<i>Then they stand still</i>

1420
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,162
Teeth?

1421
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:52,245
Teeth! Oh, yes, my precious!

1422
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:59,161
But we... We only have nine.

1423
02:04:01,960 --> 02:04:03,291
Our turn.

1424
02:04:04,080 --> 02:04:06,811
<i>Voiceless, it cries</i>

1425
02:04:07,320 --> 02:04:09,766
<i>Wingless flutters</i>

1426
02:04:10,440 --> 02:04:13,569
<i>Toothless bites</i>

1427
02:04:13,720 --> 02:04:17,008
<i>Mouthless mutters</i>

1428
02:04:19,880 --> 02:04:22,645
Just a minute. Uh...

1429
02:04:23,600 --> 02:04:25,045
Oh. Oh!

1430
02:04:25,200 --> 02:04:26,884
We knows! We knows!

1431
02:04:27,040 --> 02:04:28,530
Shut up!

1432
02:04:34,640 --> 02:04:35,926
Wind.

1433
02:04:36,080 --> 02:04:38,651
It's wind. Of course it is.

1434
02:04:38,800 --> 02:04:41,770
Very clever, Hobbitses.

1435
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:44,002
Very clever.

1436
02:04:44,240 --> 02:04:45,241
Ah-ah-ah.

1437
02:04:45,400 --> 02:04:50,281
<i>A box without hinges, key or lid</i>

1438
02:04:50,440 --> 02:04:53,967
<i>Yet golden treasure inside is hid</i>

1439
02:04:56,560 --> 02:04:57,891
Box.

1440
02:04:58,200 --> 02:05:00,601
Oh, um...

1441
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:02,928
Box. The lid and a key.

1442
02:05:03,080 --> 02:05:06,402
- Well?
- It's nasty.

1443
02:05:08,440 --> 02:05:11,046
- Box. Key.
- Do you give up?

1444
02:05:11,200 --> 02:05:14,886
Give us a chance,
precious! Give us a chance!

1445
02:05:27,440 --> 02:05:28,726
Eggses!

1446
02:05:29,280 --> 02:05:30,964
Eggses!

1447
02:05:31,120 --> 02:05:34,567
Wet, crunchy little eggses. Yes.

1448
02:05:34,720 --> 02:05:39,282
Grandmother taught us to suck them, yes!

1449
02:05:47,400 --> 02:05:50,961
We have one for you.

1450
02:05:51,480 --> 02:05:55,530
<i>All things it devours</i>

1451
02:05:55,680 --> 02:06:00,811
<i>Birds, beasts, trees, flowers</i>

1452
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:05,204
<i>Gnaws iron, bites steel</i>

1453
02:06:05,360 --> 02:06:09,160
<i>Grinds hard stones to meal</i>

1454
02:06:10,600 --> 02:06:12,284
Answer us.

1455
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:17,128
Give me a moment, please. I
gave you a good long while.

1456
02:06:17,280 --> 02:06:20,921
Birds, beasts... Beasts? Trees, flowers.

1457
02:06:21,080 --> 02:06:22,491
I don't know this one.

1458
02:06:22,640 --> 02:06:25,883
Is it tasty?

1459
02:06:26,040 --> 02:06:30,409
Is it scrumptious?

1460
02:06:30,600 --> 02:06:32,090
Is it crunchable?

1461
02:06:32,440 --> 02:06:35,250
Let me think.

1462
02:06:40,040 --> 02:06:42,122
It's stuck.

1463
02:06:43,040 --> 02:06:47,682
Bagginses is stuck.

1464
02:06:51,240 --> 02:06:52,844
Time's up.

1465
02:06:56,800 --> 02:06:58,450
Time.

1466
02:06:58,600 --> 02:07:01,251
The answer is time.

1467
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:04,965
Actually it wasn't that hard.

1468
02:07:07,360 --> 02:07:08,691
Last question.

1469
02:07:10,360 --> 02:07:12,169
Last chance.

1470
02:07:12,320 --> 02:07:14,004
Okay.

1471
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:18,562
Ask us.

1472
02:07:19,760 --> 02:07:22,491
- Ask us!
- Yes, yes. All right.

1473
02:07:26,720 --> 02:07:31,089
What have I got in my pocket?

1474
02:07:33,920 --> 02:07:35,922
That's no fair.

1475
02:07:36,680 --> 02:07:39,809
It's not fair! It's against the rules!

1476
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:43,205
Now ask us another one.

1477
02:07:43,600 --> 02:07:44,965
No. No, no, no.

1478
02:07:45,120 --> 02:07:49,091
You said ask me a question.
Well, that is my question.

1479
02:07:49,240 --> 02:07:51,607
What have I got in my pocket?

1480
02:07:53,440 --> 02:07:56,603
Three guesses, precious.
It must give us three!

1481
02:07:56,840 --> 02:07:59,081
Three guesses. Very well, guess away.

1482
02:07:59,240 --> 02:08:00,526
Handses!

1483
02:08:00,680 --> 02:08:02,409
Wrong. Guess again.

1484
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:07,925
Fishbones, Goblins' teeth,
wet shells, bats' wings...

1485
02:08:10,480 --> 02:08:12,608
Knife! Oh, shut up!

1486
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:14,569
Wrong again. Last guess.

1487
02:08:14,720 --> 02:08:17,849
String. Or nothing.

1488
02:08:18,040 --> 02:08:21,965
Two guesses at once. Wrong both times.

1489
02:08:24,920 --> 02:08:26,365
So...

1490
02:08:27,920 --> 02:08:31,402
Come, then. I won the game. You
promised to show me the way out.

1491
02:08:32,120 --> 02:08:35,010
Did we say so, precious?

1492
02:08:35,160 --> 02:08:38,323
Did we say so?

1493
02:08:41,400 --> 02:08:45,928
What has it got in its pocketses?

1494
02:08:47,160 --> 02:08:48,844
That's no concern of yours.

1495
02:08:49,480 --> 02:08:51,528
You lost.

1496
02:08:51,680 --> 02:08:53,648
Lost?

1497
02:08:55,440 --> 02:08:56,487
Lost?

1498
02:08:58,480 --> 02:08:59,891
Lost?

1499
02:09:07,040 --> 02:09:08,326
Where is it?

1500
02:09:09,240 --> 02:09:10,651
Where is it?!

1501
02:09:11,920 --> 02:09:13,001
No!

1502
02:09:15,320 --> 02:09:16,651
Where is it?!

1503
02:09:17,040 --> 02:09:19,691
No! No!

1504
02:09:21,120 --> 02:09:22,770
Lost!

1505
02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:25,207
Curse us and splash us!

1506
02:09:25,640 --> 02:09:29,690
My precious is lost!

1507
02:09:31,040 --> 02:09:35,409
- What have you lost?
- Mustn't ask us! Not its business!

1508
02:09:35,560 --> 02:09:37,483
No!

1509
02:09:37,640 --> 02:09:40,166
Gollum, gollum!

1510
02:09:52,840 --> 02:09:56,367
What has it got...

1511
02:09:56,520 --> 02:09:59,251
...in its nasty...

1512
02:09:59,400 --> 02:10:02,165
...little pocketses?

1513
02:10:12,160 --> 02:10:14,208
He stole it.

1514
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:18,410
He stole it!

1515
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:23,410
He stole it!

1516
02:10:29,080 --> 02:10:30,923
<i>Bones will be shattered</i>

1517
02:10:31,080 --> 02:10:32,241
<i>Necks will be wrung</i>

1518
02:10:32,400 --> 02:10:34,402
<i>You'll be beaten and battered</i>

1519
02:10:34,560 --> 02:10:36,005
<i>From racks you'll be hung</i>

1520
02:10:36,160 --> 02:10:40,449
<i>You will die down
here And never be found</i>

1521
02:10:40,640 --> 02:10:44,725
<i>Down in the deep of Goblin-town</i>

1522
02:10:47,640 --> 02:10:51,611
I know that sword! It
is the Goblin-cleaver!

1523
02:10:52,200 --> 02:10:53,531
The Biter!

1524
02:10:53,960 --> 02:10:57,248
The blade that sliced 1000 necks!

1525
02:10:57,400 --> 02:11:01,325
Slash them! Beat them! Kill them!

1526
02:11:01,480 --> 02:11:03,209
Kill them all!

1527
02:11:03,360 --> 02:11:05,010
Cut off his head!

1528
02:11:35,080 --> 02:11:37,321
Take up arms.

1529
02:11:37,960 --> 02:11:39,291
Fight.

1530
02:11:40,600 --> 02:11:41,886
Fight!

1531
02:11:48,680 --> 02:11:51,650
He wields the Foehammer! The Beater!

1532
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,082
Bright as daylight!

1533
02:12:03,480 --> 02:12:04,811
Thorin!

1534
02:12:18,240 --> 02:12:20,368
Follow me. Quick!

1535
02:12:23,680 --> 02:12:25,250
Run!

1536
02:12:33,520 --> 02:12:35,648
Give it to us!

1537
02:12:54,960 --> 02:12:57,884
It's ours.

1538
02:12:58,040 --> 02:13:01,601
It's ours!

1539
02:13:25,280 --> 02:13:27,886
Thief!

1540
02:13:28,920 --> 02:13:32,049
Baggins!

1541
02:13:38,200 --> 02:13:40,680
Quickly!

1542
02:13:41,400 --> 02:13:43,323
Faster!

1543
02:13:53,160 --> 02:13:54,491
Post!

1544
02:13:57,120 --> 02:13:58,201
Charge!

1545
02:14:45,120 --> 02:14:46,531
Cut the ropes!

1546
02:15:09,680 --> 02:15:10,886
Come on, quickly!

1547
02:15:11,080 --> 02:15:13,128
Come on, move! Bombur!

1548
02:15:19,440 --> 02:15:21,488
Go, go, go!

1549
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:26,411
Jump!

1550
02:15:32,160 --> 02:15:33,446
Jump, lad!

1551
02:15:53,960 --> 02:15:55,041
Come on!

1552
02:15:57,600 --> 02:15:59,011
Push!

1553
02:16:17,880 --> 02:16:19,803
Come on!

1554
02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:26,931
Come on!

1555
02:16:32,560 --> 02:16:36,326
Watch your backs!
- You thought you could escape me.

1556
02:16:39,960 --> 02:16:42,406
What are you going to do now, Wizard?

1557
02:16:50,880 --> 02:16:52,689
That'll do it.

1558
02:17:27,360 --> 02:17:29,886
Well, that could have been worse.

1559
02:17:30,760 --> 02:17:32,125
Haver!

1560
02:17:32,280 --> 02:17:34,931
You've got to be joking!

1561
02:17:40,880 --> 02:17:42,291
Gandalf!

1562
02:17:46,880 --> 02:17:49,087
There's too many. We can't fight them.

1563
02:17:49,280 --> 02:17:51,362
Only one thing will save us, daylight!

1564
02:17:51,520 --> 02:17:54,524
Come on! Here! On your feet.

1565
02:17:57,080 --> 02:17:59,287
Balin. Come on!

1566
02:18:01,240 --> 02:18:02,480
Wait!

1567
02:18:02,640 --> 02:18:06,167
My precious. Wait!

1568
02:18:06,320 --> 02:18:09,130
Gollum, gollum!

1569
02:18:13,480 --> 02:18:15,562
Quick, quick!

1570
02:18:17,600 --> 02:18:18,681
This way.

1571
02:18:21,360 --> 02:18:24,523
Come on. Come on, come on. Quickly.

1572
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:28,849
Right, good!

1573
02:19:55,880 --> 02:19:57,291
Baggins!

1574
02:19:58,600 --> 02:20:00,568
Thief!

1575
02:20:01,440 --> 02:20:05,923
Curse it and crush it!
We hates it forever!

1576
02:20:18,560 --> 02:20:21,769
Five, six, seven, eight.

1577
02:20:22,200 --> 02:20:24,441
Bifur. Bofur. That's 10.

1578
02:20:24,640 --> 02:20:27,120
Fili, Kili! That's 12.

1579
02:20:27,480 --> 02:20:30,689
And Bombur. That makes 13.

1580
02:20:30,840 --> 02:20:32,888
Where's Bilbo?

1581
02:20:33,520 --> 02:20:35,648
Where is our Hobbit?

1582
02:20:36,680 --> 02:20:38,250
Where is our Hobbit?

1583
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:42,650
Curse that Half ling! Now he's lost?

1584
02:20:42,800 --> 02:20:44,211
I thought he was with Dori!

1585
02:20:44,360 --> 02:20:47,409
- Don't blame me!
- Well, where did you last see him?

1586
02:20:47,560 --> 02:20:50,291
I think I saw him slip away
when they first collared us.

1587
02:20:50,440 --> 02:20:51,885
And what happened, exactly?

1588
02:20:52,040 --> 02:20:54,327
<i>- Tell me!
- I'll tell you what happened.</i>

1589
02:20:54,480 --> 02:20:57,324
Master Baggins saw his
chance and he took it.

1590
02:20:58,240 --> 02:21:01,244
He has thought of nothing but his
soft bed and his warm hearth...

1591
02:21:01,400 --> 02:21:03,801
...since first he
stepped out of his door.

1592
02:21:03,960 --> 02:21:06,281
We will not be seeing our Hobbit again.

1593
02:21:06,960 --> 02:21:08,564
He is long gone.

1594
02:21:20,920 --> 02:21:23,366
No. He isn't.

1595
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:29,523
Bilbo Baggins.

1596
02:21:29,680 --> 02:21:32,490
I have never been so glad
to see anyone in my life.

1597
02:21:34,560 --> 02:21:36,483
Bilbo. We'd given you up.

1598
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:38,563
How on earth did you
get past the Goblins?

1599
02:21:38,760 --> 02:21:40,330
How, indeed.

1600
02:21:49,520 --> 02:21:52,490
Well, what does it matter? He's back.

1601
02:21:53,600 --> 02:21:56,444
It matters. I want to know.

1602
02:21:58,640 --> 02:22:00,369
Why did you come back?

1603
02:22:03,680 --> 02:22:06,763
Look, I know you doubt
me. I know you always have.

1604
02:22:08,320 --> 02:22:11,290
And you're right, I
often think of Bag-end.

1605
02:22:11,840 --> 02:22:13,922
I miss my books.

1606
02:22:14,640 --> 02:22:17,405
And my armchair and my garden.

1607
02:22:18,440 --> 02:22:19,805
See, that's where I belong.

1608
02:22:20,480 --> 02:22:22,403
That's home.

1609
02:22:23,960 --> 02:22:26,042
And that's why I came back. Because...

1610
02:22:28,360 --> 02:22:31,250
...you don't have one. A home.

1611
02:22:31,920 --> 02:22:33,524
It was taken from you.

1612
02:22:36,600 --> 02:22:39,410
But I will help you
take it back if I can.

1613
02:23:12,640 --> 02:23:14,085
Out of the frying pan.

1614
02:23:14,240 --> 02:23:16,607
And into the fire. Run.

1615
02:23:16,920 --> 02:23:18,729
Run!

1616
02:23:34,080 --> 02:23:35,491
Go!

1617
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:03,365
Up into the trees!

1618
02:24:03,520 --> 02:24:06,000
All of you! Come on,
climb! Bilbo, climb!

1619
02:24:06,960 --> 02:24:08,405
Quickly!

1620
02:24:18,120 --> 02:24:19,167
They're coming!

1621
02:24:57,640 --> 02:24:59,369
Hang on! Hold on, brothers!

1622
02:25:20,840 --> 02:25:22,285
Azog.

1623
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:50,809
It cannot be.

1624
02:26:43,640 --> 02:26:45,768
It's going!

1625
02:27:35,320 --> 02:27:36,560
Fili!

1626
02:28:01,160 --> 02:28:02,241
Yeah!

1627
02:28:11,440 --> 02:28:12,930
No!

1628
02:28:19,640 --> 02:28:21,290
Oh, no.

1629
02:28:25,640 --> 02:28:27,130
Mr. Gandalf!

1630
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:34,047
Oh, no, Dori!

1631
02:29:45,040 --> 02:29:46,565
Help!

1632
02:30:04,360 --> 02:30:07,125
No!

1633
02:30:18,240 --> 02:30:20,811
Thorin! No!

1634
02:33:19,160 --> 02:33:20,571
Look.

1635
02:34:08,200 --> 02:34:09,929
Thorin!

1636
02:35:24,800 --> 02:35:26,404
Thorin!

1637
02:35:30,160 --> 02:35:31,207
Thorin.

1638
02:35:48,760 --> 02:35:49,841
The Half ling?

1639
02:35:50,920 --> 02:35:52,968
It's all right.

1640
02:35:53,400 --> 02:35:56,609
Bilbo is here. He's quite safe.

1641
02:36:06,480 --> 02:36:07,527
You!

1642
02:36:11,480 --> 02:36:13,323
What were you doing?

1643
02:36:13,480 --> 02:36:16,051
You nearly got yourself killed!

1644
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,731
Did I not say that
you would be a burden?

1645
02:36:21,440 --> 02:36:24,569
That you would not survive in the Wild?

1646
02:36:25,080 --> 02:36:27,003
That you had no place amongst us?

1647
02:36:32,600 --> 02:36:36,730
I have never been so
wrong in all my life.

1648
02:36:48,640 --> 02:36:50,244
But I'm sorry I doubted you.

1649
02:36:50,400 --> 02:36:53,290
No, I would have doubted me too.

1650
02:36:53,440 --> 02:36:56,569
I'm not a hero or a warrior.

1651
02:36:58,520 --> 02:37:00,329
Not even a burglar.

1652
02:37:19,720 --> 02:37:22,326
Is that what I think it is?

1653
02:37:37,240 --> 02:37:38,287
Erebor...

1654
02:37:39,920 --> 02:37:41,843
...the Lonely Mountain...

1655
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:46,562
...the last of the great
Dwarf kingdoms of Middle-earth.

1656
02:37:49,080 --> 02:37:51,048
Our home.

1657
02:37:55,440 --> 02:37:56,726
A raven!

1658
02:37:56,880 --> 02:38:00,089
The birds are returning to the mountain.

1659
02:38:03,400 --> 02:38:07,405
That, my dear Oin, is a thrush.

1660
02:38:08,400 --> 02:38:10,528
But we'll take it as a sign.

1661
02:38:10,680 --> 02:38:14,002
- A good omen.
- You're right.

1662
02:38:14,160 --> 02:38:17,289
I do believe the worst is behind us.
